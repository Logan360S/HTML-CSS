                        I was summoned into this pitiful mortal realm in 1991 and raised by marauding wolves. Like most younglings I had grand ambitions toward world domination, but as I matured and came to understand more about this odd realm I realised that ruling it would likely be tedious and involve far too much paperwork. And so I tempered by dreams to just playing a lot of games and trying not to punch every human I came across. Thus far I achieved one of those dreams.

                        Something clearly went wrong with my summoning because I came into this world with Cystic Fibrosis. It’s a bit of a pain in the arse. Due to this my furry parents made the choice to home-school me themselves because schools are filled with viruses, and I’m a tad more vulnerable to them. Every time I get one I add a bit more scarring to my lungs, although I hear chicks dig scars, so maybe that’s a good thing. Plus, at the tender age of 5 I was still attempting to eat most humans I came across and my parents didn’t fancy dealing with all that faff.

                        Somewhere along the line my wolf parents acquired electricity and a TV, and thus my first gaming memories are of a Sega Genesis. What a beautiful console it was, and I spent hours and hours playing the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog, Alex the Kidd and Streets of Rage.

                        My four-legged father was big on technology, and so we had computers fairly early on. It was on that and through my sire that I learned of new games like Duke Nukem, Max Payne and Total Annihilation. We used to attend to 24-hour parties where I was inevitably found playing Jazz Jackrabbit on our friend’s PC rather than talking to pesky human fools.

                        Next up was an original Playstation where I spent my time playing Mortal Kombat, racing against my older brother in Colin McRae Rally and running around in Grand Theft Auto 3. For a long while I didn’t have a memory card, so I replayed the opening hours of games over and over and over again. I fell in love with the likes of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Matt Hoffman’s Pro BMX, Command & Conquer and playing around in Music 2000.

                        Then came my Playstation 2, a whole new generation of games to play. I remember it less, though. My truly formative time came with the Xbox 360 of which I have the strongest memories. I think this was the generation that truly cemented by love of games. The first game I played on it was Gears of War, followed by The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, a game in which I’ve spent hundreds of hours over the years.

                        There was no eureka moment when I started writing about games. It just seemed like a fun thing to do one day, and I never got around to stopping. Here we are years later, and by complete accident and a series of unfortunate events I’ve wound up running a website all about reviewing games. For reasons unknown to me, you human weirdos seem to like reading some of my ramblings, and so I keep doing it. Maybe one day I’ll stop and get a life. I’ve heard they are quite good.

                        And so the poorly named http://www.wolfsgamingblog.com was born. I regret the choice of name, but at the time it was more of a blog. Now that I’m fortunate enough to deal with companies and get review code and hardware, the name is a bit problematic because many places instantly write me off to to the “blog” part. I still can’t get an article posted on N4G without it being instantly reported.

                        My aim is to deliver the most honest reviews I can. I don’t run this site for profit except for the occasion guest post which I always clearly label. I try my best to deliver honest opinions on whatever I play. Sometimes, those opinions agree with everyone else, sometimes they don’t. Quite often they deviate from the mainstream sites say.

                    My other hobbies include yelling at old people with far too much enthusiasm, playing the drums with far too much enthusiasm, reading with far too much enthusiasm and brooding with far too much enthusiasm.
